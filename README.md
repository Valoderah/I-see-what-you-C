# I-see-what-you-C

What if we have a device that professors can display outside of their doors to display when they are around and when they are not ðŸ˜Ž ?

## for the above project I have come up with the below solution:
- Display text that can be remotely changed via a phone
- The device will use IFTTT
- Receives a text and then display that text onto the screen Screensaver 
- Buzz when a new message is displayed

Tools used:
- Photon
- ILI9341
- IFTTT
- Buzzer
- DHT22
- LED
- Switch
- Resistors
